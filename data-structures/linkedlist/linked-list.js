/* 

Your Node class should have the following properties:

val - The value stored in the Node
next - A pointer the next Node in the list
prev - A pointer to the previous Node in the list (for use in stretch goal implementation)

Your LinkedList class should have the following properties:

head - The Node that represents the beginning or start of the list
Your LinkedList class should have the following functions/methods:

insert() - A function that takes any value as an argument and adds a new Node with that value to the beginning of the list (before the current head

includes() - A function that takes in a value as an argument and returns true or false if that value was found in the list
toString() - A function that takes no arguments but prints out a visual representation of the Linked List, similar to the format: { a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL
Note that any errors in your LinkedList class and methods should be well handled and logged. Donâ€™t default to the standard thrown error; instead use try catch blocks to correctly catch errors and log a user-friendly and descriptive message to the console.
