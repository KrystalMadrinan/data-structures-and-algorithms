# Reverse an Array

- Write a function that reverses the given array. Do not use built-in methods.

## Challenge

- Reverse the given array regardless of length or content.

## Approach & Efficiency

- I googled how to do it. I used the approach of a traditional for loop to loop through the given array, then push the result of that into the empty array. I then return the new array.
